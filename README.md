We will now proceed to plot our data to help us get a better sense of how each of these criteria translate to a movie's success.
*1. What movie genres are more likely to succeed?*

To find out which genres are more likely to succeed we will plot a horizontal bar graph of genres by ratings and we can see that genres like Action/Adventure/Comedy and Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi remain highly popular.

*2. How has the film industry been performing over the years?*

We analyzed the growth of the film industry by observing the trend of the average revenue of the studios from 2010 to 2018.
To understand the average box office revenue trends over time, we analyzed the yearly average gross revenue and visualized it with a line chart.

*3. What genres are most popular across different regions?*
This analysis was conducted by examining the runtime distribution of genres by region. 
These insights will help us better understand the characteristics of popular genres and their performance across different regions.
